# CS305-Artemis-Financial-Project

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. For this project, I secured a public web interface and ensure that client data was protected.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I implemented Encryption and Hashing to provide for secure data transmission. Dependencies were tested and their vulnerabilities were examined to determine their significance to the security of the system. Encrypting sensitive information minimizes the risk of data breaches. Data breaches are very costly to company resources, mainly money, time, and reputation. Software security ensures a company maintains a strong reputation regarding the quality of their systems used for services, avoiding the loss of client trust from data breachs while also keeping their business operating smoothly.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Going through the long list of vulnerabilities and their lengthy descriptions was challenging at first, but as I became more familiar with the dependencies and the system I was securing, it became easier to quickly rule out which vulnerabilities were relevant or not.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I used RSA encryption and SHA-256 hashing algorithms to secure data. Understanding the different needs of the client with the strenghts and weakness of different encryption models is essential in understanding how to secure a system from potential exploits.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Maven and OWASP's dependency checking tool were both very helpful tools that I will be using in the future. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I will show employers my skills in securing code through my implementation of encyrption algorithms and with my background in dependency vulnerability checks.
